# Webbing Spool
3d model of a parametric spool for webbing

## Inspiration
I really liked the [climbing webbing spool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2325788) made by [DtEW](https://www.thingiverse.com/dtew/designs) but wanted some changes. namely - the ability to easily spool off webbing. This one change led to many iterations.

## Changes
This model was made from scratch by me in OpenScad - even though the base object looks pretty much the same externally.

The spool wheels are still printed individually, but now have a central annular snap-fit joint & pin to hold them together and allow for rotation. Webbing retaining clips were added one wrap off from central hub.

The model is mostly (all?) parametric, but with little to no in-code error checking. Any number of spool wheel holes can be created, and any width and length webbing can be accommodated.

Future version will hopefully have MOLLE attachment points as well.

## Files
This didn't start in git so I have several file versions that I'll upload here in some backwards attempt to preserve some change history. More details to come when I finish throwing files up.
